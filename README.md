# To-Do
Simple App to demostarte my skills in vanilla JavaScript and Using LocalStorage.

## Project content:
The project contains Two pages ( **Welcome page** and **main page** ) using (HTML , CSS AND JS ) .
**Main page** contains an input box and an add button .

**Local storage** is used in this project to help keep my data whenever I get back to this app.

- As a user, I need to be able to:<br>
- [x] add tasks to the to-do list.<br>
- [x] Check the tasks I finish.<br>
- [x] Remove the tasks I decide not to do or for any reason I want.<br>
- [x] If I close the tab, refresh the page, check any tasks I finish, the tasks will not be removed. :partying_face:<br>
